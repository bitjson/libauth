   * It is recommended that single-device entities share as much user agent
   * information as possible; this allows other entities to tailor user
   * experiences, by e.g. providing app-specific guidance, notifications about
   * pending security updates, and security assessments about a wallet's overall
   * exposure to supply-chain vulnerabilities from various sources.
   *
   * Hypothetically, it's possible that hiding single-device user agent
   * information from less-trusted entities might prevent those entities from
   * exploiting active vulnerabilities in some portion of the user agent.
   * However in practice, few publicly-known vulnerabilities exist at any moment
   * in time, and a compromised entity is likely to attempt exploitation of any
   * vulnerability regardless of claimed user agent information. As such, the
   * negligible security value of hiding this information rarely outweighs the
   * user experience and security improvements made possible by sharing it.
   *
   * The recommendation to share all user agent information does not extend to
   * multi-device entities (`userAgent.type` of `person` or `organization`);
   * these entity types are used to represent an opaque set of user agents
   * controlled by the indicated person or organization. In these contexts,
   * user agent information could offer attackers valuable clues for planning
   * and successfully carrying out social engineering attacks, extortion, and
   * physical attacks on the individuals and organizations participating in a
   * wallet. Instead, user agent information for these multi-device entities
   * should only be shared within the separate, shared wallet created to
   * maintain the multi-device identity used in the higher-level wallet.
   *
   * For example, an "Operations Team Wallet" may consist of several `person`
   * entities which do not share user agent `app`/`device`/`os`, but each
   * `person` entity would be controlled by a separate wallet shared across that
   * individual's devices. Each of that person's devices should share all user
   * agent information with each other in the sub-wallet, but no
   * `app`/`device`/`os` information would be revealed in the team wallet.
   *
   * For multi-device entities, it is recommended that only `engine` be shared,
   * indicating the minor version of the most-capable engine used by any of the
   * entity's devices. For example, if the entity includes 4 devices, where 3
   * devices use Libauth versions `2.0.1`, `1.0.5`, and `2.1.2` respectively,
   * and the final device uses application-specific signing software, the
   * `engine` should be `{ name: 'Libauth', version: '2.1' }`.

     * - `online` (`üåê`): An online device that does not closely match another
     * available value, e.g. a web server or service, an internet-connected TV
     * or household appliance, etc.
     * - `organization` (`üë•`): A multi-device entity that is controlled by

     * - `person` (`üë§`): A multi-device entity that is controlled by a single
     * individual.
     * - `unknown` (`?`): The entity cannot determine or refuses to share a
     * user agent type.
     * - `vision` (`üëì`): A head-worn wearable device with a vision-based
